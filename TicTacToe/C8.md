# Tic-tac-toe Done!

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a tic-tac-toe smart contract with Solidity. Here is the full code for reference:

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.10;

// based on the skeleton file TicTacToe.sol by
// https://github.com/spidfire

contract TicTacToe {
    uint[] board = new uint[](9);
    address player1;
    address player2;
    uint whoseTurn = 1;
    bool full = false;

    constructor() public{
        player1 = msg.sender;
    }

    function joinGame() public {
        require(!full);
        player2 = msg.sender;
        full = true;
    }

    function doMove(uint _place) public returns (uint){

        uint winner = checkWinner();
        if(winner == 1){
            return 1;
        }
        if (winner == 2){
            return 1;
        }
        // correct users is on turn
        if(whoseTurn == 1){
            if(msg.sender != player1) return 2;
        }else if(whoseTurn == 2){
            if(msg.sender != player2) return 2;
        }

        // is on the board
        if(_place < 0 || _place >= 9) return 3;

        // Is not already set
        if(board[_place] != 0) return 4;

        board[_place] = whoseTurn;
        whoseTurn = 3 - whoseTurn;


        return 0;
    }



    uint[][]  tests = [[0,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8], [0,3,6],[1,4,7],[2,5,8], [0,4,8],[2,4,6]  ];
    // 0 1 2
    // 3 4 5
    // 6 7 8
    function checkWinner() public view returns (uint){
        for(uint i =0; i < 8;i++){
            uint[] memory b = tests[i];
            if(board[b[0]] != 0 && board[b[0]] == board[b[1]] && board[b[0]] == board[b[2]]) return board[b[0]];
        }


        return 0;
    }

    function currentState() public view returns(string memory, string memory) {
        string memory text = "No winner yet";
        uint winner = checkWinner();
        if(winner == 1){
            text = "Winner is X";
        }
        if (winner == 2){
            text = "Winner is O";
        }


        bytes memory out = new bytes(11);
        byte[] memory signs = new byte[](3);
        signs[0] = "-";
        signs[1] = "X";
        signs[2] = "O";
        bytes(out)[3] = "\n";
        bytes(out)[7] = "\n";

        for(uint i =0; i < 9;i++){
            bytes(out)[i + i/3] = signs[board[i]];

        }

        return (text, string(out));
    }

}
```

You can add more features or modifications if you like. If you would like to deploy this game on either the actual Ethereum blockchain or a testnet (a parallel blockchain that works identically to the real one but where ether is considered to have no value), you can do the following: 

1. Download [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), a browser extension that allows your computer to connect to the Ethereum blockchain. This extension also serves as an Ethereum wallet that you can use to send and receive ether.

2. You will need to spend a small amount of ether to publish a smart contract. If you want to deploy on the Ropsten testnet, you can get testnet ether for free using the [Ropsten faucet](https://faucet.ropsten.be/). If you want to deploy on the the mainnet, then you will need to buy ether on an exchange like [Coinbase], [Circle](https://www.circle.com), [Gemini](https://gemini.com), or [Abra](https://www.abra.com).

3. Then, you can use Ethereum's [remix IDE for smart contract development](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to publish your smart contract on the testnet or mainnet.
