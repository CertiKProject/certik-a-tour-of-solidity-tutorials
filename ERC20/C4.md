# Approval and Allowance

In addition to the basic function of transfering tokens from one party to another, the ERC20 token standard also includes the ability to delegate spending to a trusted person. 

How this works is that any User A can call `approve` with the first parameter as the address of any User B, and the second parameter as a number representing an amount of tokens. User B will then be allowed to transfer that amount of tokens to whomever he wants on behalf of User A. Essentially User A is appointing User B as a trusted financial advisor of sorts.

If User A wants to revoke the ability for User B to spend her funds, she can just call `approve` again but with an allowance of zero.

If User B spends User A's entire allowance, User A can call `approve` again to delegate more tokens to User B.

Implement the remaining three functions: 

1. `approve`, which should work as described above

2. `allowance`, which should simply return the amount of tokens a given user has approved for another given user to spend

3. `transferFrom` which should allow User B to transfer User A's money if he has the permission.
