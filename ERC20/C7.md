# No Zero Address Allowed

This is less critical than protecting against overflow and underflow, but is another good practice to put in all your smart contracts. When you are transfering to any address, you should put in a check to make sure that the address is not `0x0`. 

This is because it is very easy to accidentally send tokens to the zero address if one neglects to specify an address parameter, since the default value for undefined addresses is `0x0`. If tokens are sent to the zero address they are assumed lost forever, since nobody owns the private keys to the zero address. Therefore this can be a very expensive mistake. As of right now, [the zero address holds about $1.4 million worth of ether](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000), meaning that apparently this mistake is made fairly often. (Although some of this might be from people deliberately "burning" their ether).

Todo:

1. Add checks to prevent transfers to the zero address in all functions where it's applicable.
