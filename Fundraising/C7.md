At this point, contributers can add to the fund, and get a refund when the fundraising is unsuccessful. The owner can open up a new fundraising project with a desired amount for the goal. Once the goal is met, the owner can withdraw the funds. If the goal is not met, the donators can get a refund. 

Right now, people will have to query the blockchain over and over in order to check if the goal is met and if they are allowed to withdraw / get a refund. Is there a way that we can instead notify them once this happens?

It turns out that there is. `event`s in Solidity can alert blockchain clients that a certain action has happened. Using this feature, you do not have to constantly ping the chain to check whether an event has occurred or not. We can declare an event like so:

`event Donation(uint amount, address contributor);`

An event is sort of like a struct, in that it consists of a sequence of variables of predetermined types. This event consists of an amount (of  ether) and an address of a contributor. 

We can output the event like so:

`emit Donation(msg.value, msg.sender);`

Blockchain clients can be set up to listen for these events and take certain actions once they occur. Additionally, clients can retrieve an event log where they can look down the list of all events the contract has ever emitted and learn some information about the history of the contract's behavior.

Let's go through and add events for each existing function that we have.
