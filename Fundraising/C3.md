# Withdrawing the Funds

Now the owner of the contract can collect and record values from donors for fundraising.

However, the current contract only collects values and does not transfer it anywhere. If the contract goes online now, it will just endlessly collect ether without having any wany to spend it. That's bad! :/

Let's allow the creator of this smart contract to withdraw the funds stored in it at any time. Create a constructor that records the address of the creator in a state variable, and write a function which only the creator can access to send the money in the contract back to the creator. 

Recall that we can transfer ether like so:

```
//some integer variable to represent the amount of ether being transferred
uint v = 5000000; 
// an Ethereum address;
address a = 0xaAEA5E3309ef626Fc022B85C87Ee4782820331B6;
// transfer v ether to a
a.transfer(v); 
```
