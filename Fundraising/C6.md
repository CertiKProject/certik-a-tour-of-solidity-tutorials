# Additional features

Great! Now we have a fully fuctional smart contract that will collect funds from donors and let the owner withdraw from a successful campaign. It also lets the donors reclaim their funds after an unsuccessful campaign.

Still, there are some small additions that we can make in order to make the contract even more impressive.

1. Let's add a function that will return a percentage value representing how close the campaign is to reaching its fundraising goals. (Note that floats do not exist in Solidity, meaning that this value will need to be returned either as a `uint` or a `string`.)

2. Let's also add a function that will return the top donor to the contract thus far. Perhaps this will incentivize people to donate more :). Can we do this without a `for` loop? 

(For an extra challenge, try augmenting this function to return the top three donors thus far).
