# Refund policy

Now the owner can withdraw from the contract to his account!

However, we still want to make some improvements to the contract. Let's say the donors only want to give the donation to the owner of the contract once a fundraising goal is met. Since they do not want to give their money to an unsuccessful fundraising project, this makes sense.

Let's think of how we will introduce this functionality. We will need to define as state variables a fundraising goal and a time limit for the contract. If the goal is reached before the time limit, then the owner of the contract should be able to withdraw the ether inside it. If the goal is not met, however, the donors should be able to withdraw their money back out of the contract. 

Can you figure out how to implement the proper functions with the proper guards so that this behavior is possible?
