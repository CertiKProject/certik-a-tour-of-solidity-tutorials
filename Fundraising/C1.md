# Grabbing the Money

In this module, we will build a fundraising smart contract from scratch. Fundraising smart contracts can be used to crowdfund a project such as a new blockchain platform. This has been an activity that many people have found Ethereum to be useful for.

Reminder: `payable` enables the function to accept values when called. A brief example of a payable function is described below.

```
function add() payable public returns (string) {
      uint v = msg.value;
      if(v > 5 Ether) {
            return "Thank you for your generous donation!";
      } else {
            return "You couldn't have sent more? Cheapskate...";
      }
}
```

This `add` function will look at how much Ether was sent tothe function and capture it in a `uint v`. Note while the function itself does not do anything with the value given, the incoming Ether is still stored in the contract after the function terminates. This means that the amount of Ether that the user sent will be added to balance of the account associated with the contract's address. That balance is now available for the smart contract to spend.  

Try it yourself:

  1. We are starting from scratch again. Begin the file with a `pragma`, with a version equal to `^0.5.10`.
  2. Write a contract named `Fundraising`.
  3. In the contract, write a function named `add`, which should be able to take in public transfers of Ether.
  4. Leave the function empty for now, as we need to add more stuff inside the contract to make the function work.
